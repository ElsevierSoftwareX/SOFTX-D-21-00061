|graspi| was conceptualized in 2012 at Iowa State University by
Baskar Ganapathysubramanian, Olga Wodo, Srikanta Tirthapura, Sumit Chaudhary, and Jaroslaw Zola.
In the initial stage, the need to quantify and understand the morphology in organic solar cells
was the science driver behind |graspi|. Over years, we added more descriptors and
used |graspi| in various data-driven avenues.

In 2019, the project has been supported by National Science Foundation (QRM award number  `QRM`_).
Since then we are expanding |graspi| to be more generic and translatable to other applications.
