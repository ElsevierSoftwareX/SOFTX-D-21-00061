 GraSPI functionality
==============================================

|graspi| computes a library of descriptors for a segmented microstructure
and computes descriptors that are relevant for organic solar cells performance.
The package computes two types of descriptors: scalar descriptors and array descriptors.
The scalar descriptors are directed to the standard output, while array descriptors are directed to the corresponding file.
The array descriptors corresponds to the shortest distances and are saved in the following files:

* DistancesGreenToRedViaBlack.txt
* DistancesGreenToBlueViaWhite.txt
* DistancesBlackToRed.txt
* DistancesWhiteToBlue.txt
* DistancesBlackToGreen.txt
* TortuosityBlackToRed.txt
* TortuosityWhiteToBlue.txt


The names of the file indicates the conditions used to filter the graph.
For example file DistancesBlackToGreen.txt stores all the shortest distances between any donor/black/0 voxel and the interface/green.
If there is no direct connection between source vertex and the target vertex, the distance is set to inifinity.
This is is how ``boost`` library is initializing the distance vector.
The distances are save in the order of the labels from the input file.
The infinity distances are maintained to maintain capability to map back the distances to the input voxels.

|graspi| provides one function where a set of descriptors are computed - see documentation for more details:

.. doxygenfunction:: graspi::compute_descriptors_only
