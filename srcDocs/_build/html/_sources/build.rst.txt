Go to src folder and at the command line:
.. code-block:: bash

  make


As a result the executable ``graspi`` will be compiled. |graspi| requires boost
library, you need to download it and install it. If the location of boost is not added to the environment variable (in unix),
you need to explicity add it to the search paths in the makefile.
|graspi| at the time of release was tested with version boost_1_72_0
