Welcome to GraSPI's documentation!
==================================

|graspi| is graph-based structure property identifier software implemented as a C/C++ package.
|graspi| computes a library of descriptors for a segmented microstructure
and computes descriptors that are relevant for organic solar cells performance.
The package represents microstructure as a graph and harnesses the graph-based
theory to compute wide range of descriptors at low computational cost.
A suite of tools for data conversion between various formats and for
post-processing the raw results from the graph analysis is provided.
